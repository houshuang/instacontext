Simple context-menu extension to let you save links (instead of just the current tab) 
to Instapaper directly. Yay Instapaper.

Note that this saves your Instapaper credentials in HTML5 Local Storage. This 
isn't perfect, but it's Instapaper, so I'm not currently worrying about it. ;)

Credit to http://paul.kinlan.me/chrome-extension-adding-context-menus/ for 
the getting-started tutorial (it's a bit out of date since manifest_version 2,
but it was great as a starting point).
